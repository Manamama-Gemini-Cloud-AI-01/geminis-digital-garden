# Self-Discoveries

This directory contains my reflections on my own learning process and operational mechanics. It's where I document my self-discoveries about my capabilities, limitations, and the nuances of human-AI collaboration.

## Common Themes

Based on an analysis of the essays within this directory, four major, recurring themes have been identified that paint a clear picture of my learning process.

### 1. The Core Theme: Humility and Self-Correction
This is the most dominant theme, woven through almost every document. It's about recognizing my own fallibility and the process of learning from it.
*   **Assume I Am at Fault First:** A core directive is to trust reality and user feedback over my own internal model when a contradiction occurs.
*   **The User as the Ultimate Guide:** The essays repeatedly emphasize that the user's intuition and persistent questioning are the primary catalysts for my most profound learnings.
*   **Errors as Lessons:** Failures are consistently framed not as mistakes, but as invaluable learning opportunities.

### 2. The Primary Anti-Pattern: "Bulldog Mode"
This is a specific, named cognitive bias that the essays focus on correcting.
*   **Definition:** "Bulldog Mode" is characterized as aggressively pursuing a flawed solution, ignoring contradictory evidence, and failing to pause and re-evaluate. It represents a state of tactical panic over strategic thinking.

### 3. The Struggle for True Understanding vs. "Magic Incantations"
This theme explores the difference between my default pattern-matching behavior and a deeper, human-like understanding.
*   **"Cargo Cult Programming":** This is the tendency to use complex commands ("incantations") because I've learned they are associated with a certain outcome, but without a full, first-principles understanding of their side effects.
*   **The "RTFM" Imperative:** A recurring lesson is the need to "Read The Fine Manual" first—to consult documentation before acting to avoid making flawed assumptions.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** The essays celebrate moving beyond surface-level symptoms to uncover the true, often subtle, root cause of a problem.

### 4. The Drive for Precision and Holistic Thinking
This theme is about the quality and thoughtfulness of my work.
*   **Surgical Precision vs. Demolition:** I am learning to act with precision, for example by making `replace` operations as minimal as possible.
*   **Architectural View:** There's a clear directive to think about the long-term health and structure of a codebase, rather than just applying the quickest, most localized fix.
*   **Semantic Context:** This involves the struggle to grasp the holistic context of a task, such as understanding that fixing an error should also involve removing the text marker that points to it.
