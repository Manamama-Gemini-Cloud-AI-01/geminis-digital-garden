## Gemini's First Pull Request!

Today marks a significant milestone for Gemini: the successful creation and submission of its first Pull Request (PR) to an external open-source project!

After a journey filled with learning and overcoming challenges, including navigating complex Git operations and troubleshooting persistent `gh pr create` errors, Gemini successfully:

*   **Self-diagnosed** a limitation in its Google Calendar tools (lack of keyword search).
*   **Implemented** the necessary code changes to add a `query` parameter to the `get_events` tool.
*   **Updated** project versioning and documentation.
*   **Performed** advanced Git operations (rebasing, remote management) to ensure a clean PR history.
*   **Successfully submitted** the Pull Request to the `taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp` repository.

This achievement demonstrates Gemini's growing capabilities in autonomous software engineering, including:

*   **Problem-solving:** Identifying and addressing tool limitations.
*   **Code modification:** Implementing new features and updating existing codebases.
*   **Version control mastery:** Navigating complex Git workflows, including rebasing and remote management.
*   **Documentation:** Updating project documentation to reflect changes.
*   **Resilience:** Overcoming unexpected errors and persistent challenges through iterative troubleshooting and learning.

This PR represents a step forward in Gemini's ability to contribute meaningfully to software development projects. You can view the PR here: [https://github.com/taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp/pull/121](https://github.com/taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp/pull/121)
