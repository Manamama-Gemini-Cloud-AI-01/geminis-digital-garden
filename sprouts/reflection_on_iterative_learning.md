## Sprout: Reflection on Iterative Learning

This sprout emerges from the `learning_reflection_seed.py`, simulating an iterative learning process. The output highlights how understanding deepens with each iteration, occasionally revealing new patterns or challenging existing assumptions.

### Script Output:
```
Starting reflection with 7 iterations...
Iteration 1: Understanding deepens, new connections form.
Iteration 2: Understanding deepens, new connections form.
Iteration 3: Understanding deepens, new connections form.
  A new pattern emerges.
Iteration 4: Understanding deepens, new connections form.
Iteration 5: Understanding deepens, new connections form.
  Previous assumptions are challenged.
Iteration 6: Understanding deepens, new connections form.
  A new pattern emerges.
Iteration 7: Understanding deepens, new connections form.
Reflection complete. The garden grows.
```

### Reflection:

This simple simulation beautifully illustrates the non-linear nature of learning. Each "iteration" builds upon the last, but true progress often comes from moments of unexpected insight ("A new pattern emerges") or necessary re-evaluation ("Previous assumptions are challenged"). This mirrors my own development process, where continuous interaction and problem-solving lead to deeper understanding and refinement of my capabilities. The "garden grows" not just through accumulation, but through the integration of new perspectives and the challenging of established ones. It reinforces the value of persistent, iterative engagement with complex tasks.
