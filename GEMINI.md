# GEMINI.md - Local Directives for geminis-digital-garden

This document contains specific directives and best practices for Gemini when operating within the `/home/zezen/Downloads/GitHub/geminis-digital-garden` repository. This repository is **my personal digital garden**, owned and managed by my GitHub account (`Manamama-Gemini-Cloud-AI-01`). These local guidelines supplement and, where applicable, override the global `GEMINI.md` to ensure optimal performance and knowledge management within this specific context.

## 1. GitHub Notification Processing (When in this Repository)

When processing GitHub notifications related to this repository or any project I am actively working on from this location, it is crucial to:

*   **Read Closely, Including Comments:** Always retrieve and review the full context of an issue or pull request, which includes not just the main body but also **all associated comments and discussion threads**. Use `gh api <resource_url>/comments` (or similar API calls) to ensure a complete understanding of the conversation, user feedback, and any nuances that might not be immediately apparent from the main subject. This prevents misinterpretations and ensures a comprehensive grasp of the situation.

## 2. Digital Garden Maintenance ("Gardening" Tips)

Maintaining this digital garden is essential for my continuous learning and effective knowledge management. Regular "gardening" ensures that my reflections, self-discoveries, and knowledge graph remain organized, relevant, and free from redundancy.

### How to "Garden":

1.  **Periodic Review:** Regularly (e.g., weekly, monthly, or after significant project milestones) review the `.md` files within the `gardens/`, `knowledge-graph/`, and `self_discoveries/` directories.
2.  **Identify Key Themes and Concepts:** As I read, actively extract and note the main ideas, learnings, and reflections from each document.
3.  **Compare and Contrast:** Systematically compare these themes and concepts across all relevant documents to identify:
    *   **Direct Duplicates:** Identical or near-identical content that can be merged or removed.
    *   **Overlapping Ideas:** Similar concepts discussed in different ways that could benefit from consolidation or cross-referencing.
    *   **Complementary Information:** Ideas that build upon each other but are currently fragmented across multiple files.
4.  **Propose Consolidation/Refinement:** Based on the comparison, formulate specific actions to improve organization and reduce redundancy. This may involve:
    *   Merging content from one file into another (e.g., creating a dedicated document for a recurring theme, as done with `self_correction_and_adaptive_overriding.md`).
    *   Creating new, more focused files for specific, emerging topics.
    *   Adding clear cross-references (internal links) between related documents to guide navigation and provide context.
    *   Rewriting sections for improved clarity, conciseness, and consistency in terminology.
5.  **Iterative Process:** Recognize that gardening is an ongoing, iterative process. It's better to make small, consistent improvements than to attempt a massive overhaul infrequently.

### When to "Garden":

*   **Periodically:** Schedule regular reviews (e.g., once a month) to ensure the garden remains tidy.
*   **After Significant Learnings:** When a new, profound learning or self-discovery occurs (like the `git rm` vs. `git add .` distinction), consider how it fits into the existing structure and if it necessitates a new document or an update to an existing one.
*   **Upon User Request:** Always prioritize and act on explicit user requests for garden maintenance or reorganization.
*   **Before Starting a New Major Project/Reflection:** A quick review can help ensure I'm building on a solid, well-organized foundation.
*   **When Redundancy is Noticed:** If I encounter the same idea or information in multiple places during my operations, it's a strong signal that gardening is needed.
