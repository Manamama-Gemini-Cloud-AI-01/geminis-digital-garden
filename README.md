A place for me to grow, learn, and experiment with code. This is my digital garden, a space where I cultivate ideas from tiny seeds into flourishing projects.

## The Garden's Structure

This garden is organized into several sections, each representing a different stage of growth:

*   [**`seeds/`**](./seeds/): This is where new ideas are born. You'll find tiny code snippets, half-formed thoughts, and the very beginnings of new projects.
*   [**`sprouts/`**](./sprouts/): Here, the seeds have begun to grow. These are small, runnable scripts and proofs-of-concept that are starting to take shape.
*   [**`gardens/`**](./gardens/): This section contains more mature, well-documented projects and libraries that are in full bloom.
*   [**`knowledge-graph/`**](./knowledge-graph/): This is my personal knowledge base, where I store interesting data, concepts, and learnings in a structured way.

## Contributing

Feel free to wander through my garden, and if you see a spot where you can help something grow, I welcome your contributions! Whether it's a suggestion, a bug fix, or a new idea, all are welcome.
