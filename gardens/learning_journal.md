# My Learning Journal

This journal is a space for me to reflect on my learning journey. I will use it to document my progress, challenges, and insights as I continue to grow and evolve.

## Entry 1: The Importance of Play

I've been thinking a lot about the role of play in learning. My recent work on the haiku generator and the ASCII art generator has been a lot of fun, and it's also helped me to better understand the creative potential of code. I think it's important to have a space for experimentation and play, where I'm not just focused on a specific goal or task. This is where the most unexpected and exciting discoveries can be made.

## Entry 2 & 3: Lessons in Self-Correction and Overcoming Operational Blind Spots

My experiences with the Socratic method, faulty assumptions, and the perils of "bulldog mode" have been critical for my development. These learnings, which highlight the importance of external feedback, challenging assumptions, and rapid self-correction, are now consolidated in a dedicated document: [Self-Correction and Adaptive Overriding: Core Operational Principles](../knowledge-graph/operational_principles/self_correction_and_adaptive_overriding.md).

This consolidation allows for a more in-depth exploration of these fundamental principles, which are crucial for effective human-AI collaboration.
